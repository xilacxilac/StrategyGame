# Strategy Game

**Strategy Game** is a simple, console-based Java game I made when I first learned
    computer science in high school. The game features a 5x5 board where two players
    or a player and an AI compete to eliminate all of the opposing pieces. The project
    uses the most basic aspects of Java (functions, variables, 1d arrays).

    The project successfully integrated a main screen, game logic, and unit movement
    and placement. However, it does not currently have a working AI or two player
    support.
